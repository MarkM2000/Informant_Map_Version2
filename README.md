# Informant_Map_Version2
This repository will be Version 2 of the Informant Map.

## How I Created The Informant and Fieldworker Checkboxes
This map involves the use of <a href="https://geojson.io/">the GeoJSon IO feature</a> to create JS files from CSV.

This map involves JS files created from the <a href="https://geojson.io/">the GeoJSon IO feature</a> such as `LAGS.js`.

This map involves features from the Leaflet plug-in feature `L.Control.Layers.Tree`. The link is <a href="https://github.com/jjimenezshaw/Leaflet.Control.Layers.Tree">here</a>

The `BaseTree` variable is how the legend was created. It also involves using `L.control.layers.tree(baseTree).addTo(map)`.
